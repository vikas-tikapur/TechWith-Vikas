    <h2>What is Python?</h2>
    <p>Python is a powerful and versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
      It is a high-level, interpreted language that supports object-oriented and functional programming 
      styles. With dynamic typing and built-in data structures, Python is ideal for developing web 
      applications, data science projects, automation scripts, and more.
    </p>

    <p>Its clean and straightforward syntax makes it beginner-friendly, while also offering robust tools for 
      experienced developers. Python’s modular approach, support for reusable code through packages and 
      libraries, and a vast standard library make it a popular choice across industries. Additionally, 
      Python is open-source and available for free on all major operating systems.</p>

    <h2>History of Python?</h2>
    <p>Python is a popular programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. 
      The development of Python began in December 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in 
      the Netherlands. Guido wanted to create a language that was easy to read and write, while also 
      being powerful and flexible.</p>
    
    <p>The first official release of Python was in 1991. Python was designed to be simple and easy to 
      understand, making it ideal for beginners as well as experienced programmers. Its name, Python, 
      was inspired by the British comedy group "Monty Python," reflecting Guido’s desire for a language 
      that was fun to use.</p>

    <p>Over the years, Python has grown rapidly in popularity. Its clear syntax and large standard library 
      made it suitable for a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific research, 
      artificial intelligence, and data analysis.</p>

    <p>Python’s community also grew, contributing many powerful libraries and tools that extended the 
      language’s capabilities. Today, Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the
      world.</p>
    <h2>Why Learn Python?</h2>
    <p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world — and for good reason. 
      Here’s why learning Python can boost your skills and open doors to exciting opportunities:</p>
    <h2>key features of Python?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Simple and Easy to Learn: </b> Python has a clean and readable syntax, making it easy to write 
        and understand code.</li>
      <li><b>Interpreted Language: </b> Python code is executed line-by-line, which simplifies debugging and testing.</li>
      <li><b>High-Level Language: </b> Python abstracts away most of the complex details of the computer, 
        allowing you to focus on programming logic.</li>
